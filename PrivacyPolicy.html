        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
          feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
          any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
