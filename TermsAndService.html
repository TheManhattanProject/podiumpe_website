          <h4>Informal Negotiations</h4>
          <p>
            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
            controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a 'Dispute'
            and collectively, the 'Disputes') brought by either you or us

            Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
            those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least
            sixty (60) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
            negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the
            other Party.
          </p>
          <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
          <p>
            Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms,
            including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
            termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
            International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
            Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)
            according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring
            to it, is considered as the part of this clause. The number of
            arbitrators shall be three (3). The seat, or legal place, or
            arbitration shall be Bhopal, India. The language of the proceedings
            shall be English, Hindi. The governing law of these Legal Terms
            shall be substantive law of India.
          </p>
          <h4>Restrictions</h4>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
            the general public or any other persons.
          </p>
          <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
            above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding
            arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
            concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
            of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
            of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
            any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
            be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
            court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of that court.
